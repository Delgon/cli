In our experience it leads to overly complicated updates requiring significant administrative effort when taking into account the range of operators running in a cluster across numerous namespaces. If you desire control over updates we highly recommend the use of our static operator catalogs. Automatic Updates \uf0c1 Goal: I want to receive updates automatically as soon as they are available Solution: Use the dynamic catalog and automatic approval strategy The content in this catalog is updated regularly. Multiple installations at different times will not necessarily be identical because package updates are being delivered to the channels. Only security updates and bug fixes will be delivered this way (software updates). Software upgrades require the user to explicitly change a subscription channel. Tip This is the recommended way to install IBM Maximo Application Suite in a connected environment. It will ensure that you recieve vulnerability fixes and critical defect fixes as soon as they are available. User Controlled Updates \uf0c1 Goal: I want to control when updates are introduced into my cluster Solution: Use one of the static catalogs and automatic approval strategy The packages available in these catalogs are fixed. Multiple installations at different times will always result in exactly the same version of all operators being installed. When you are ready to apply updates you simply modify the CatalogSource installed in your cluster, changing it from e.g. v8-220717-amd64 to v8-220805-amd64 .

By choosing the same static catalog across multiple clusters the customer will be guaranteed that their installations are identical, right down to the patch level of the operators installed.

Disconnected Install Limitations \uf0c1 Disconnected install for IBM Maximo Application Suite is supported from MAS v8.8 onwards with some restrictions: Application First Version to Support Air Gap Core v8.8.0 ( v8-2022-07-17-amd64 ) Assist No support Health & Predict Utilities No support IoT v8.5.1 ( v8-2022-08-05-amd64 ) Manage v8.4.0 ( v8-2022-07-17-amd64 ) Monitor No support Optimizer v8.2.0 ( v8-2022-07-17-amd64 ) Predict No support Safety No support Visual Inspection No support Installation Overview \uf0c1 Disconnected Install Preparation Prepare your Private Registry Mirror Container Images Configure OpenShift to use your Private Registry for MAS Install MAS Disconnected Install Preparation \uf0c1 Prepare the Private Registry \uf0c1 If you do not already have a private registry available to use as your mirror then you can use the setup-mirror function to deploy a private registry inside a target OpenShift cluster. docker pull quay.io/ibmmas/cli docker run -ti quay.io/ibmmas/cli mas setup-registry The registry will be setup running on port 32500. For more details on this step, refer to the setup-registry command's documentation. Regardless of whether you set up a new registry or already had one, you need to collect the following information about your private registry: Name Detail Private Hostname The hostname by which the registry will be accessible from the target OCP cluster. Private Port The port number by which the registry will be accessible from the target OCP cluster. Public Hostname The hostname by which the registry will be accessible from the machine that will be performing image mirroring. Public Port The port number by which the registry will be accessible from the machine that will be performing image mirroring. CA certificate file The CA certificate that the registry will present on the private hostname. Save this to your home directory. Username Optional. Authentication username for the registry. Password Optional. Authentication password for the registry. Mirror Container Images \uf0c1 Mirroring the images is a simple but time consuming process, this step must be performed from a system with internet connectivity and network access your private registry, but does not need access to your target OpenShift cluster. Tip You can also use this command to mirror the images for OpenShift itself, but that is beyond the scope of this guide. docker pull quay.io/ibmmas/cli docker run -ti quay.io/ibmmas/cli mas mirror-images You will be prompted to set the target registry for the image mirroring and to select the version of IBM Maximo Operator Catalog to mirror and the subset of content that you wish to mirror You can choose to mirror everything from the catalog, or control exactly what is mirrored to your private registry to reduce the time and bandwidth used to mirror the images, as well reducing the storage requirements of the registry. This command can also be ran non-interactive, for full details refer to the mirror-images command documentation.
